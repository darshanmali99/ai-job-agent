🎯 How It Works
Scoring Formula
# Step 1: AI Semantic Score (0.0-1.0)
ai_score = keyword_based_semantic_analysis(job)

# Step 2: Keyword Skill Match (0.0-1.0)
keyword_score = matched_skills / total_required_skills

# Step 3: Hybrid Score
hybrid_score = 0.7 * ai_score + 0.3 * keyword_score

# Step 4: Company Reputation
company_score = 1.0 (Tier 1) | 0.85 (Tier 2) | 0.4 (Tier 3)

# Step 5: Final Rank
final_rank = 0.5 * hybrid_score + 0.5 * company_score
Telegram Filter
if company_score >= 0.85:  # Tier 1 or Tier 2
    send_telegram_alert()
else:  # Tier 3
    log_to_csv_only()  # Suppressed
